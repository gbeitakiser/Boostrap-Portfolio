        Hey there! My name is Gabriel and I'm an odd creature to say the least. I was born in Oakland, California but moved to San Jose, 
        Costa Rica when I was three. After attending kindergarten there, I moved to Tucson, Arizona when I was 5 and stayed there through college. 
        I studied sustainable architecture and city planning at the University of Arizona and graduated with a B.S. in 
        Sustainable Built Environments.
    </p>

    <p>
        After graduating and interning with Tucson's Office of Integrated Planning, I realized that I love to write and grew impatient with the bureaucracy 
        of city government. I took a 180-degree turn and found a job as an automobile journalist in San Francisco, where I currently reside. 
        I test cars and write about them for a living, but I have an unquenchable thirst for learning
        and an outright obsession with technology and the many ways it shapes our world. That thirst led me to attend this coding bootcamp
        where I aim to learn how to interact with computers on a deeper level.
    </p>

    <p>
        Let me be clear, my focus isn’t just technology but on how to change the underlying systems that govern our society and dictate 
        the direction of our species. I see a great need to adapt and evolve these systems to help us confront the problems we face as a society. 
        Technology is an ally and a powerful tool that can help us solve problems like climate change and wealth inequality. 
        I want to learn the language of computers so that I can advance these causes. 
    </p>
